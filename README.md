## Overview

This project contains two assembly programs:

### Register Dump

The register dump program outputs the current values of all general-purpose registers. It is useful for debugging and understanding the state of the processor at a specific point in program execution.

### Stack Backtrace

The stack backtrace program traverses the call stack and prints out the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in execution. This helps in debugging by showing the path taken through the code.

## Usage

Use "Make all" to run the test file for both programs.
